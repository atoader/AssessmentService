\begin{definition}  
  Welding is a fabrication or sculptural process that joins materials, usually metals or
  thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. This is often done by melting the workpieces and
  adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to
  become a strong joint, with pressure sometimes used in conjunction with heat, or by
  itself, to produce the weld.

  A \defii{weldment}{design} is a \trefi[design]{design} of an artefact whose components
  are mainly joined by \trefi{welding}.
