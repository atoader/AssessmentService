\begin{module}[id=rope]
\begin{definition}
  A \defi{rope} is a linear collection of plies, yarns or strands which are twisted or
  braided together in order to combine them into a larger and stronger form. Rope is
  thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, line, string, and twine.
\end{definition}

\begin{assertion}[type=observation]
  Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting, but are far too
  flexible to provide compressive strength. As a result, they cannot be used for pushing
  or similar compressive applications.
\end{assertion}
